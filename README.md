# ONLINE-BOOK-SHARING-PLATFORM

Every Institute has students who requires books for their academics. 
Majority students prefer buying second hand books rather than buying new books, since the new books are costly and majority of the syllabus content are same in both. As a fresher, student buy new books at high prices because they are unaware of the second hand books sellers like their own college juniors. So, we are solving this issue by providing a digital platform website wherein juniors as well as seniors can directly contact each other for reselling and buying their second hand books.
